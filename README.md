Mobile Phone Price Range Prediction Project

The mobile phone market is rapidly expanding, leading to increased competition among electronics companies. To capture a larger market share, companies continually innovate and improve their products. However, estimating the optimal price for a mobile phone is a complex task, especially for new companies or those launching a novel product. Pricing directly impacts sales and profitability, and many factors—including demand, technology, marketing, brand value, availability, user experience, and after-sales service—play a role in determining a mobile phone's price range.

This project aims to predict the price range of a mobile phone based on various product features, helping companies make data-driven decisions when setting competitive prices.

Project Objective

The goal of this project is to estimate the price range for a mobile phone using key features collected from various similar companies. By analyzing these features, we aim to predict the optimal price range for a new mobile phone in the market, enabling companies to set prices competitively and maximize their sales potential
